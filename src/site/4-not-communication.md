**Coding Interview does not address communication, commitment and humility.**

There are other important attributes we should look for in team players. None of them is strong algorithm solving. One such essential quality of a team member is humility. The second is equally important: a strong work ethic. The third attribute is emotional intelligence and having common sense around understanding people and using our words and actions to bring out the best in others. Widening the perspective here, the common denominator of these traits is communication. Software development, in essence, is just that: the form of communication between team members.
