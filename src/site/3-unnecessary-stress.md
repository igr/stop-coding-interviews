**Coding Interview simulates highly unrealistic and unnecessary stress.**

What was the last time you had to develop a key functionality under 10 minutes while your bosses were watching you? You're right. Never. 1) you never, ever develop while your peers are looking at you. 2) You will never, ever code an essential component alone, without any tests, in a ridiculously short amount of time. 3) The first solution that comes to your mind is not often the right one. And finally, 4) the most stress in the development comes from the flaws in organization and communication and not from writing the code.
