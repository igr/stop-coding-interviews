**Coding Interview does not measure problem-solving capabilities either engineering capacity.**

Writing code is _not_ the essential quality of a software engineer. A good software engineer means _much more_. Communication, abstract thinking, knowledge of the full-stack, ability to learn and grow, business acumen, time management, interpersonal skills, collaboration, empathy etc. Writing algorithms for solved academic problems challenge none of these attributes.
