**Coding Interview is superficially inefficient and unreliable.**

Coding interviews focus poorly on engineering talents. By putting algorithmic skills up in front, we indirectly develop the culture of "code monkeys." They rave about the code,  type a lot, and read none. A coding interview is just a quick-and-dirty excuse for finding a coding workforce, not a fellow human engineer. The development world does not need more coding skills. We need more critical thinkers and mature software engineers.
