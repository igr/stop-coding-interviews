**Coding Interview does not represent real-life project scenarios.**

What was the last time when you wrote an algorithm that inverts a binary tree? That's right. Never. Because software development is _not_ computer science. Instead, software development is a skill that _applies_ computer science and design to build valuable products. A software development project is about the pragmatic utilization of existing, proven tools. In the real world, developers primarily deal with abstractions and patterns. A puzzle would be a better test than an algorithmic coding task: it shows dedication to everyday tasks while focusing on the bigger picture :)
